## Spatial Analysis Project:
The science and technology from the proposed project will provide a framework for urban tree planting and will be included in the State of the Urban Forest – Dallas 2013 report. This report will impact how urban forestry planning, planting and funding is supported by policy makers, corporations, and foundations. The results will help us provide the needed education, through analysis, that can be utilized to integrate tree planting on a watershed scale in the City of Dallas. The support from Azavea will help us position the importance of trees in South Dallas, our low income underserved neighborhoods. We will be better able to address environment justice issues, economic development challenges, water runoff, air pollution, and energy use.

Part I: Evaluating the impact of canopy change on community health in South Dallas

Growing South Dallas is an initiative that Mayor Rawlings is leading to improve the quality of life in our southern neighborhoods. The Southern Sector of Dallas is large, covering an area 196.7 square miles in size, larger than Boston, Miami, and San Francisco combined, representing 49% of the City’s land mass. Of that area 169.4 square miles are considered developable land. Also contained in South Dallas is half of the City’s 30% tree canopy and the 6,000 acre Trinity Forest, the largest contiguous bottomland hardwood forest in America.

The southern sector because of lower land values and population growth is prime for development. As development expands, it CAN NOT be at the expense of the environment, and what makes South Dallas unique. This project will help us position the Texas Trees Foundation to support sustainable growth and urban forestry initiatives as Growing South Dallas moves forward. Part I of this project will be to perform an evaluation of the impact a large scale canopy change would have on the community health in South Dallas. Included in this would be to identify high risk areas for canopy loss due to development, identifying areas that need to be preserved (ex. riparian buffer zones), and potential areas for future tree planting to mitigate for trees that are lost in the development process.

Part II: Analyzing potential tree planting locations and prioritizing areas based on environmental and economic factors

Urban Trees are a major capital asset to the City of Dallas. Just as streets, sidewalks, public buildings, and recreational facilities. The overall urban forest composes the green infrastructure of the city and is a major asset that requires care and planning as other major city assets. Dallas urban forest provides immeasurable environmental benefits to the community including improved air quality, protected water resources, reduces energy consumption, and improved economic sustainability.

The overall goal of the Roadmap is for the long-term enhancement of the City’s landscaping and livability for its citizens but considerations must also be given to making sure that the right tree is planted in the right place. Part II would be to perform a more detailed analysis of the cost and benefits of large tree planting initiatives. Included in this would be a list of potential tree planting sites that could handle large numbers of trees while maximizing their environmental benefits. This will allow us to engage stake holders and provide them with clear numbers when determining their return on their investment. These identified tree plantings could be buffer initiatives for waterways and the Trinity Forest, trail/green corridors, etc.

#### Data available:
We have a standing agreement with the City of Dallas to utilize any and all GIS data sets relevant to this project. Some of the data sets are listed below and a full list can be made available at your request.
- Heat Islands
- Buildings
- Public buildings
- Census data
- City limits/Council Districts
- Flood Zones
- Watersheds
- Land use
- Land cover
- Riparian areas
- Sidewalks
- Neighborhood boundaries
- Canopy cover
- Potential Planting sites

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:
- Various planting locations prioritized by high, medium, and low level of importance in terms of environmental benefits by city parks, schools, neighborhoods, and major arterials.
- Further break down of these sites into the number of potential planting location; 25-50, 50-100, and 100+.
- South Dallas parcels that are at high risk to being developed.
- South Dallas parcels that are in high need of protection. (Riparian corridors)
- Analysis of how large scale changes in tree canopy could affect certain environmental factors such as heat islands, air pollution, and storm water run-off and the effects they will have on the overall health of the Southern Sector of Dallas.
- Report on the potential loss of the environmental and economic impact if the tree canopy in South Dallas where to drastically drop and the cost to replace it.
- Cost benefits analysis of large scale tree planting initiatives.

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
- Protect, manage and replant the urban forest to reach a canopy cover of 40%
- Provide recommendations to the City of Dallas to support a comprehensive urban forestry program
- Educate decision makers about the important of sustainable development through ecosystem management
- Inform decision makers about the urban forest in the City of Dallas to set a baseline for future decisions
- Texas Trees Foundation can utilize the results of this work to reach a goal of planting 25,000 trees a year
- Identifies projects for potential fundraising
