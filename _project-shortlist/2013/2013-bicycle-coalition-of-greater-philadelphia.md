## Spatial Analysis Project:
First, determine areas of high bicycle activity based on Bicycle Facilities (lanes, racks), Bike Crashes, Bike related fatalities, and Bike Thefts. Second, provide more detail on fatal bike crashes and locations. Third, determine if there is a correlation between bike theft and availability of bike parking.

#### Data available:
- Bicycle theft location data (Philadelphia Police Dept)
- Philadelphia City Bicycle Crashes (Philadelphia Health Dept and Mayor's Office of Transpo)
- Bike Fatality locations (Fatality Accident Reporting System)
- Bicycle Count Data (DVRPC)
- Current Bike Facilities (Bike Lanes, Multi-Use Paths, Sharrows)
- Bike Rack Locations (Mayor's Office of Transportation)
- Transportation to Work by Census Tract (U. S. Census American Community Survey)
- Proposed bicycle facilities (Philadelphia Bicycle Plan)
- Households with Zero Vehicles (U.S. Census)

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:
- Bike Activity Index â€“ Scoring locations with high bicycle activity. ACS Transportation to Work, -Zero Vehicles Available, DVRPC Bike Counts, bike thefts and bicycle crashes. This could be a heat map (preferred) or thematic census tract map
- Interactive Fatality Bike Crash Map - Provide details (scroll over points) on fatal bike crashes within the last ten years.
- Bike Theft heat map - locate bike theft hot spots with bike rack locations

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
- Overlay the Bike Activity Index with the current bike network and bike facilities proposed in the City's bike/ped plan to prioritize street improvements. When annual repaving schedules are released every year, we can then compare streets that are proposed to be repaved against the priority streets and advocate more effectively for which streets in the paving contracts should get new bike facilities.
- Release fatality crash map on our website.
- Use bike theft heat map to advocate for more bike parking and targeted PPD enforcement.
