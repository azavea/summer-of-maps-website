## Spatial Analysis Project:
Spatial analysis exploring correlation of public health and socio-economic characteristics to tree canopy cover of Greater Los Angeles. The fellow will be asked to map and analyze disparate data sets (e.g., public health indicators including asthma hospitalizations, median household income and ethnicity), overlay these with tree canopy cover (TCC) data, and identify areas of highest need (those with of low TCC, low income, high asthma occurrences, etc.)

#### Data available:
TreePeople has access to TCC data for the city of Los Angeles and will seek access to TCC data for the County of Los Angeles. Public health data and demographic data necessary to complete this project is readily available from the City and County of Los Angeles GIS data portals, and demographic data are available through the US Census Bureau. TreePeople commits to ensuring that necessary datasets will be available, and if we cannot obtain TCC data for the County, then the project scope will be limited to the City of Los Angeles, where data are already guaranteed.

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:
We would like maps for the target geographies (up to 5 target geographies), as well as a presentation or report interpreting these.

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
TreePeople will use the project maps and reports to prioritize programmatic activity and in communicating priorities to policymakers, funders and community partners.
