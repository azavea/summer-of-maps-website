## Spatial Analysis Project:
The project will plot and analyze retail food access points in targeted low-income communities in each of the 5 boroughs. It will compare and contrast these locations with other City Harvest programming and the need (based on income, poverty levels, SNAP recipients, areas with residents who qualify for SNAP but perhaps do not receive the benefits).

#### Data available:
Public Data:
- The raw data from the Department of Agriculture and Markets including supermarkets, bodegas, mom and pop shops, warehouses and other establishments that sell food.
- Census data results of NYC income and poverty levels targeting
- Census tracts
- SNAP benefit recipients and qualifiers

City Harvest specific data:
- List of Supermarkets and Corner Stores who are members of City Harvest’s Healthy Retail program.
- List of Emergency Food Providers in City Harvest’s network, along with non City Harvest EFP’s
- List of all City Harvest program locations including but not limited to Mobile Markets, Fruit Bowls and Courses.

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:
We expect to see maps of targeted high need, low income, communities in each of the 5 boroughs specifically to see if our previous efforts of targeted interventions fall in areas of need, where there is overlap or missed opportunities. We would also like a report of untapped food retailers in which to target for partnerships to provide programming (Nutrition Education, Cooking Demonstrations, Shop Healthy on a Budget Shopping Tours, etc.) from the analysis.

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
City Harvest will use the results to evaluate previous intervention locations to ensure we were targeting high need areas and to present this data to internally, to our Board and donors. Internally we would like to use the maps to analyze where we can grow our programming with new possible partners and identify other possible high need areas for programming.
