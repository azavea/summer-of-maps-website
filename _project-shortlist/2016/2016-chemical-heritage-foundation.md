## Spatial Analysis Project:
The Chemical Heritage Foundation’s Museum is applying for an Azavea Summer of Maps GIS student to create a potentially interactive visualization that showcases compelling and meaningful air quality data to the public. This is the first in a series of prototype, digital reinterpretations of scientific instruments designed to test how to make the stories and relevance of these instruments more accessible to the public using digital approaches. The project will provide an opportunity for the fellow’s work to be showcased in various public settings.

This data visualization will accompany interpretation of a historic smog sensor built by legendary instrument maker Arnold Beckman in Los Angeles in 1952. Data is available from the EPA and Philadelphia’s Air Management Services from air quality sensors around the US at the national, regional, and local levels. Data from local, mobile air quality sensors may also be available to provide an additional, live data stream.

#### Data available:
Three datasets will be available to support this GIS-based analysis and visualization project:

1. National EPA air quality data – EPA air quality data over time from their sensors located throughout the US, including information on over a dozen chemicals from hundreds of sites. We could compare our work to the EPA’s existing online air quality mapping system as well.
2. Regional EPA air quality data –A (possibly unique) subset of the national air quality data (e.g., Pennsylvania, the Delaware Valley, etc.), plus local data managed by Philadelphia’s Air Management Services.
3. Local air quality data – In addition to the local data available from EPA and Air Management Services, the dataset may also include “live” data from mobile sensors that we plan to purchase and deploy during the summer of 2016 in and around Philadelphia, targeting areas where the EPA currently does not have air quality sensors or data.

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:
The student will be responsible for producing either three separate data visualizations at three different scales (national, regional, and local), or one data visualization that transforms dynamically as users change the scale. In the visualization, users will be able to access air quality information for a variety of pollutants over time and as far back as data is available. At each scale, users have the opportunity to change the types of chemicals displayed as well and also depending upon the available data.

This spring, the EPA is releasing portable air quality sensors, of which we plan to purchase four or five. If these portable sensors become available and produce a datastream into which we can tap, the student will be responsible for creating a visualization that adapts dynamically to data as the locations of the portable sensors change from week to week for exploration by the public.

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
The visualizations (maps) will be used in the CHF Museum gallery to test and evaluate how effective the interactive digital presentation of air quality over time is in connecting historic research with the use and application of scientific instruments and data today. The maps and visualizations will be set in the context of significant historic artifacts and interpretive information associated with air quality research. This interpretive information includes graphic panels, photos, text, and scientific instruments that describe and display tools associated with research into air quality in the US and London at the time Arnold Beckman devised his original smog sensor (1950s). Feedback and results from the testing and evaluation of visitor engagement with this initial prototype will be used by the Chemical Heritage Foundation to inform future digital interactives and experiences in the gallery.
