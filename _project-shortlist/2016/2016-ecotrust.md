## Spatial Analysis Project:
Change detection using aerial photography from ~2005-2015 will help quantify the rate of tree removal and planting across Portland. Change detection from aerial imagery in 2014 and 2015 will also help identify the extent of tree removals (but without targeting individual landowners) occurring outside of the City's permitting process, to inform City strategies for outreach and engagement in particular neighborhoods. More advanced analysis could assess zoning and land-use allocations in Portland's emerging 2035 Comprehensive Plan with City on-site tree density standards, and be applied to estimate and visualize future urban forest attributes for comparison with ongoing urban forest trends. The extent (% cover), composition (tree form), and geographic distribution of trees may inform priorities for retaining and planting trees, particularly large form trees, and consider the intersectionality of development planning and environmental justice in terms of equitable distribution of urban canopy and contribution of trees to Portland's Climate Action Plan.

#### Data available:
Tax lot boundaries in Portland metro area, Comprehensive Plan zoning, land-use, and street designations, and geodatabase of Portland's current street tree inventory. If this project is accepted, we would make a public records request of tree removal and planting permits for the City for 2015. Census data would also be helpful for socioeconomic metrics of interest, particularly income and racial and ethnic composition. Other permit data on demolitions, crime, and new construction permits can also be gathered.

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:
Maps showing historical tree removals and appearances from aerial imagery, rates of change, as well as current and future tree canopy and composition. Corresponding maps with relevant demographic, economic, and urban development indicators to enable visual assessment of equitable distribution of green and gray infrastructure and investments. Graphs and/or tables showing these metrics as well. Exploratory analysis of geospatial data identifying geographic areas with unique or relevant trends, hotspots, etc. to be covered with brief narrative reporting and supporting graphs and maps as needed to illustrate these findings.

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
In February 2016, Portland City Council begins emergency rulemaking regarding removals of large healthy trees in development situations. Recently-adopted tree preservation policies have proven wholly inadequate while real estate values are rising dramatically inside Portland's Urban Growth Boundary. Several blockades of properties and tree-climbing by protesters occurred in 2015. In late 2016-2017, the City expects to re-open the Tree Code for comprehensive revision. In this same timeframe, Portland's City Forester will prepare a new Urban Forest Management Plan. This GIS analysis could directly inform and help shape these policies. To date, most policy discussions have occurred with little-to-no basis in data that is increasingly available and useful (if analyzed to provide meaningful information). These results will likely be used by the Portland Urban Forestry Commission, the Tree Code Oversight and Advisory Committee, Portland's Urban Forestry program, and various stakeholders to advocate for more effective and equitable urban forest policies.
