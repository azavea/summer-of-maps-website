## Spatial Analysis Project:
We know that pedestrians are disproportionately represented as victims in Philadelphia road crashes. This project would delve deeper into the analysis of fatal crash data and correlate it with census data to determine what other groups may be over-represented in traffic deaths. A statistical analysis of demographic data of crash victims will reveal any inequity in crash distribution.

#### Data available:
We have complete crash data sets and census data for the last 5 years.

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:
Products:

Maps: fatal crash data and census demographics. Each crash would be mapped with the statistics listed below associated with each crash location. Depending on what the data reveals, there could be maps of individual characteristics.

Statistics: Crash location, victim type (pedestrian, bicycle, etc.), age, sex, vehicles types, seatbelt use; Census data including: income, race, median house price, poverty levels, etc.

The report would describe in detail any statistical correlations that would indicate over-representation of fatal crash victims within any of the census demographic categories.

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
The maps and reports would provide a deep analysis of the nature of crashes in Philadelphia and would guide Vision Zero efforts to reach those most affected by fatal crashes. In lobbying for support for a robust Vision Zero policy, BCGP has found that City Council is very interested in knowing how crashes affect their constituents. While there has been extensive analysis of the crashes, we are not aware of any reports, to date, have delved into the census data to find correlations and potentially highlight inequities. This data driven approach would inform both Vision Zero policy and action items to make Philadelphia streets safer for all users.
