## Spatial Analysis Project:
The Notebook would like assistance in developing four maps to evaluate how catchment areas for schools have changed as a result of the Renaissance Schools Initiative. Starting with the 2010-11 school year, neighborhood schools were turned over to charter operators. How have the changes affected catchment areas and feeder patterns?

These maps over time would likely illustrate how the catchment areas and feeder patterns in different neighborhoods are being consolidated for different charter providers, e.g. "the balkanization of the School District."

#### Data available:
- SABINS has been gathering school catchment GIS data, http://www.sabinsdata.org/userresources/project-description
- We have existing maps of Renaissance Schools locations (http://www.thenotebook.org/renaissanceschools-page), and could provide necessary additional data and material.

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
