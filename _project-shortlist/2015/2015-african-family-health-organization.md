## Spatial Analysis Project:
Northeast Philadelphia (especially lower Northeast) has a lack of healthcare services available to the uninsured populations living there. At an even greater risk for not getting access to care due to numerable barriers are African and Caribbean immigrants and refugees (ACIR), particularly those who are Limited English Proficient. AFAHO would appreciate assistance with analyzing the healthcare needs and availability of services to address these needs among ACIRs living in Northeast Philadelphia. Some of the data to be reviewed include: examining the actual numbers of this population that live in the area and where they're clustered geographically; the sources of healthcare available and where they're located; some of their barriers to accessing care and the two most common health issues facing this population.

#### Data available:
AFAHO has demographic, zip code, barriers to care and other data for the ACIR population accessing our services. Philadelphia Department of Public Health has data about city health centers in Northeast Philadelphia serving the uninsured and demographic and healthcare data for their African and Caribbean clients; American Community Survey has demographic data for this population; the U.S. census and the Community Health Database for access to healthcare, barriers to health and other health related data.

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:
ACIRs are normally classified as Black/African-American for reporting purposes and this classification limits the ability to understand the actual number of those populations residing in greater Philadelphia and what their healthcare needs and trends are. A map will hopefully show numbers, gender and age of ACIRs, where they reside in Northeast Philadelphia and locations of primary care serving the uninsured. Descriptive and analytical reports will display barriers to care and most common health issues.

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
The maps and reports will provide AFAHO with the information to better understand the demographic make-up, barriers to care and common health issues within our target population as well as the sources of primary care available to them. This will help us determine the need for a culturally and linguistically sensitive source of primary care in that area; our ultimate goal. The map and reports will also be presented to sponsors and funders for support.
