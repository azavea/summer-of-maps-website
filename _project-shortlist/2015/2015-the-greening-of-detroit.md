## Spatial Analysis Project:
The Greening of Detroit is looking to spatially analyze the current tree canopy within the Cities of Detroit, Highland Park and Hamtramck, and how tree canopy density relates to various data components (City Council Districts, population density, storm water issues, public health, etc.). The fellow will be asked to analyze and help prioritize areas throughout these three cities in an effort to increase the urban tree canopy from 22.5% to 40%.

#### Data available:
Data sets include inventory of trees planted by the Greening of Detroit, inventory conducted by Davey Tree Resources, Detroit Water and Sewage Department (DWSD) areas of concern, Southeast Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG) population and demographic data, Michigan Department of Community Health data on cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses and fatalities, as well as heat related illness, injury and fatalities, vacancy and blighted parcels, and City of Highland Park and City of Hamtramck population data.

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:
A comprehensive map depicting total tree canopy in Detroit, Highland Park and Hamtramck is expected. As well as, a map and analysis depicting public health, occupancy, and environmental benefits the increase of urban tree canopy will provide. Prioritization and suggestions to infill the gaps in tree canopy in order to increase community planting and community engagement efforts is also expected.

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
The maps and reports will allow the Greening to engage funders and civic leaders, assist the project managers in on the ground implementation, assist leadership with presentation tools and prioritization of project areas, and assist the community engagement staff in grant writing, organization development, and community outreach events.
