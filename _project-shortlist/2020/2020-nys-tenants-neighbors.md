## Spatial Analysis Project:
New York State Tenants & Neighbors is proposing to conduct a spatial analysis project on Housing Quality and Health Outcomes in New York City.  Every year, the Office of the New York City Public Advocate develops and releases a list of the 100 Worst Landlords in New York City.  Our project will use New York City health data to draw parallels between substandard housing and health outcomes. Simple, we believe that areas with worst landlords are also areas where New York City residents experience the worst health outcomes.

#### Data available:
A variety of data sources from New York City open data portal will be used including 2019 100 Worst Landlord List developed by the NYC Public Advocate's office.

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:
We will create maps showing the locations of buildings with worst housing quality and health outcomes. We will develop a housing and health fact sheet per neighborhood and a report that will be shared with other housing advocates, elected representatives per district with the worst quality housing, the Mayor's office on Tenant Protection and the Public Advocate's office.

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
The maps will be used primarily by our housing organizers when they are out in the field and by our advocacy and lobby arm of the organization (Tenants & Neighbors Action) to educate policymakers for better laws that protect tenants' health and guarantees safe, decent and affordable housing.
