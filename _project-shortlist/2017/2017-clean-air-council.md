## Spatial Analysis Project:
The Council’s project would build on the City of Philadelphia’s bike parking capacity study to gain a better understanding of how to predict adequate bike parking facilities. This would be used by employers, developers, government, and nonprofits. The Council is interested in identifying what factors lead bicyclists to demand for bike parking.

This project would be an analysis of how factors such as proximity to bike paths and trails, employment density, land use, and type of bike rack influences the demand and use of bike parking.

An ideal end result would be a formula that identifies how much bike parking is necessary to serve a particular location, based on these factors. If successful, this formula will be used to advocate for proper facilities in both new development projects and existing locations that lack adequate parking. The Council might also advocate that a formula like this be adopted into zoning regulations.

#### Data available:
- Bicycle parking data for Center City was last compiled as part of the Mayor’s Internship Program in 2013. This study includes formal and informal bike parking, type of rack, and use.
- The University of Pennsylvania has an interactive bike rack web map for the campus.
- A Google map was crowd sourced in 2013 in response to the Philadelphia Magazine article, “Where is covered bike parking in Philadelphia?”
- Employment data including commute type exists for Census block group. In some cases more specific data is available through organizations like Building Owners and Managers Association, Center City District, and University City District.
- The City and DVRPC both have bike infrastructure data containing bike lanes and trails. The City has land use data, and can identify commercial corridors.
- Indego bike share statistics can be used as a baseline information of bicycle commuters to Center City and could help estimate demand for bicycle parking.

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:
A successful project would help us visualize bike parking demand based on employment, land use, transportation infrastructure, and other relevant factors, matched with existing bike parking infrastructure, and highlighting locations where there are gaps. An ideal map or set of maps would include existing bike rack infrastructure differentiating type of bike parking and level of use, supplemented with an employee density layer showing concentrations of employment throughout Center City, an infrastructure layer that details bike lanes and trails, and a land use layer identifying commercial corridors and type of business.

This would be accompanied by a report outlining gaps in bicycle parking infrastructure as well as recommendations for bike racks installation in high demand areas.

Ideally a formula would be created as a guide to the City and private businesses recommending what bike parking capacity is needed based on conditions such as employment, land use, and transportation infrastructure.

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
Maps and reports will be used to inform government, businesses, and NGOs such as Center City District, University City District, and Building Owners and Managers Association on bicycle parking needs in Philadelphia. Analysis will be used as a catalyst to spark private and public investment to install bike parking based on need. Data will illustrate to businesses the gaps in bicycle parking around them and supplement existing studies. This will strengthen the Council’s argument to businesses about the economic value of providing bicycle parking to potential consumers and their employees.

Maps that illustrate where adequate bike parking does exist could be included in regional bike maps as an additional educational outreach tool.

Maps and reports can also be used as a guideline for places outside of Center City such as the Navy Yard and other commercial corridors to guide how much bike parking is necessary in those areas.
