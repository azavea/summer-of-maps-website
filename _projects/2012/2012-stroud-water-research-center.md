The mission of the Stroud Water Research Center is to advance our global knowledge and stewardship of fresh water systems through research and education.

Driven by the philosophy that understanding the science of fresh water is fundamental to their ability to protect the integrity of this finite and vital resource, the Center seeks to disseminate its research findings to its peers in the scientific and educational communities, as well as businesses, landowners, policy makers and individuals, to enable informed decision making that affects water quality and availability in our local communities and the world around us.

They accomplish their goals through the pursuit of both basic and applied scientific research, as well as through educational programs, which serve audiences ranging in age from elementary school children to adults in continuing education programs.

Angela worked on a project that seeked to understand how changes in the vegetation immediately adjacent to a stream, known as the riparian buffer, impact stream geomorphology and the fish community. This goal was accomplished by:

- quantifying the spatial distribution of stream geomorphological characteristics over 2 kilometers of White Clay Creek across a transition between +150 year old woods, +20 year old woods, and a meadow
- testing for the stability of stream geomorphology within each riparian vegetation type between the summer of 2011 and the spring of 2012 when two large floods occurred
- testing for connections between stream geomorphology and fish community abundance and biomass between the three riparian vegetation types
