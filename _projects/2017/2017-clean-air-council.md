# About the project
Clean Air Council is a member-supported environmental organization serving the Mid-Atlantic Region. The Council is dedicated to protecting and defending everyoneâ€™s right to breathe clean air. In this project, the Council initiated a crowdsourcing effort to collect workday bike parking data in Center City Philadelphia. With the data, the Council will better understand the landscape of bike parking across Center City.

This project is composed of two parts. The first part is a visualization of the bike parking data through different aspects. In the second part, Jianting constructed linear regression models to predict for bike parking demand. The study shows that land use, employment, distance to bike lanes and average interpolated Indego bike share trips contribute the most to the predict for bike parking demand. The study concludes with recommendations for areas to add new bike racks and a cross validation for each of the statistical methods.
