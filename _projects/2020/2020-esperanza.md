Esperanza is a non-profit organization devoted to empowering the residents of Hunting Park, Philadelphia through educational programs that cultivate financial, educational, and personal growth. In partnership with numerous local organizations such as Philadelphia Parks & Recreation (PPR), the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society (PHS), and more, Esperanza is strategizing a neighborhood-level forestry plan that aspires to achieve 30% total tree canopy coverage. This plan will serve as the first formal tree planting effort under the Philadelphia Urban Forest Strategic Plan, which is currently in the planning process. The Esperanza - Summer of Maps project seeks to guide the neighborhood-level forestry plan, and the main project components are to:

- analyze the existing tree canopy
- identify physically suitable locations for trees
- determine the areas most in need of additional trees within Hunting Park

To better understand Hunting Park’s physical characteristics, Evelyn conducted a site suitability analysis which identified land that has the capacity for additional street, yard, and commercial/industrial tree plantings. The results of the site suitability analysis indicate that Hunting Park has the potential to attain at least 36% tree canopy coverage.

To identify the neighborhood’s census block groups and street segments that are most in need of additional tree plantings, Evelyn developed a composite prioritization index that is based on criteria established by Evelyn, Esperanza, and the project partners. The project concludes with a recommendation to next combine the findings of the site suitability and prioritization analyses.
