City Harvest is working to end hunger in New York City by rescuing over 100,000 pounds of food each day. This entails collecting excess food from restaurants, grocers, bakeries, markets, cafeterias, manufacturers and farms – which are then delivered for free to community food programs all across the city. In addition, educational programs are offered such as nutrition lessons, cooking demonstrations and grocery shopping tours.

Amory conducted spatial analysis that identified high-need areas for program expansion and increasing partnerships. City Harvest provided data on their locations and Amory collected other public data like income, poverty, and SNAP recipients. Through GIS, City Harvest’s presence as well as highly vulnerable areas were visualized. This lead to identifying the gaps in service. Deliverables include static maps, web maps, and a mobile market story map.
